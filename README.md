### Develop Locally

 You will need to download and install a copy of Node.js from https://nodejs.org/. NPM will also come bundled with Node. 
 Follow instructions to setup Node on your machine. You can decide whether to add a global copy of npm to your path. These
 instructions assume you do. You will also need git bash which you can download at https://git-scm.com/downloads.
 
Fork this repository and download the copy to your machine. Alternatively, you can clone this repository directly.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/willm78/brewtown.git
```

then `cd` into the download directory and install dependencies with

```sh
npm install
```

This project is set up to use expo which you can read about at https://expo.io/. You can install the XDE tool from the website, 
however it is not absolutely necessary. Instead you can install the exp command line tool with

```sh
npm install -g exp
```

Next, download the expo app on your phone, create an account and run

```sh
expo start
```
